# Elm Chart library

An Elm library for creating simple horizontal and vertical bar charts, and for pie charts.

This library supports three basic chart types. The horizontal bar chart is built with simple div elements (based on an idea from [D3]()); the vertical one uses a flexbox layout and some CSS transforms, while the Pie chart builds on [this post](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2015/07/designing-simple-pie-charts-with-css/) using Svg elements.
